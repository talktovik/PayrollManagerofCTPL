//Class Library creation. 
First I think I have to Focus on the Most Important Factor which is how to set up the 
Employee class.
because there are lot of stuff this class consists and even though it is not very much required 
only data like Bank Details are required frequently.

I have to make a dataLayer.

I have to create a Response Class.
Now What we can do is We can look at those table and calculate the
salary via given by excel

I already have attendane module so no worry. 
I will simple take the code and impliment it here.
wallah created
